## Session: 2026-03-30 — Project Initialization

**Participants:** Phil, Claude

**Work done:**
- Evaluated Gemini's initial project framing (applied research / model-driven architecture). Assessment: solid on project management framing, weak on domain-specific technical due diligence.
- Identified The Finished Book and Keith Ammann's TMKWTD as the two foundational pillars.
- Established `/docs` folder structure and docs-as-code approach in GitHub repo.
- Rejected GitHub Wiki in favor of `/docs` in-repo (rationale: disconnects from code on Wiki, no version control parity).
- Rejected Cowork as project management tool (rationale: designed for file/task automation, not multi-AI architectural workflow; adds unnecessary tool layer).
- Completed full live-site audit of The Finished Book (all articles across Theory, Classes, Monsters sections as of March 2026).
- Produced `finished-book-summary.md` — covers all 20+ articles including six gaps missed by Antigravity/Perplexity in prior draft: Encounter Multiplier (full derivation), XP Approximations (three tiers), PC-side XP and daily economy, Magic Items as encounter variables, Variability series (full statistical layer), and 2024 rules EM change.
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/MarsBoundJ/dnd-combat-simulator
- Repo is public. `.gitignore` uses Python template + manual additions for GCP credentials, `.env`, Foundry `.db` files, and `node_modules`.

**Key decisions:**
- Exponential XP formula (`1.077^(AC+AB-15)`) chosen as engine truth over linear and published-monster approximations.
- 2024 rules: encounter multiplier defaults to 1.0 when using published 2024 XP values.
- Conditions resolved through eHP/eDPR adjustments, not ad-hoc damage modifiers.
- EV mode vs Sampled mode must never be mixed in the same encounter run.
- No engine code written until `pillars-reconciliation.md` is complete.

**Open items carried forward:**
- [ ] Draft `ammann-behavior-framework.md` — next priority
- [ ] Draft `pillars-reconciliation.md` — blocked on Ammann doc
- [ ] Decide: MCTS vs rules-based for monster AI
- [ ] Decide: data source for monster stat blocks
- [ ] Decide: Foundry VTT version to pin
- [ ] Decide: 2014 rules, 2024 rules, or both?
